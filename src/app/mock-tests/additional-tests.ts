Their rapid design cycle and ability to be updated swiftly offers a powerful response to emerging pathogens.\n\nWhich of the following statements BEST accounts for the speed with which mRNA vaccines can be adapted to a new viral strain?`,

Prime editors involve a catalytically impaired Cas9 fused to a reverse-transcriptase enzyme, together with a prime-editing guide RNA (pegRNA).
