# Implementation Summary: Payment and Subscription System

This document summarizes the implementation of the Supabase, Razorpay and Clerk Auth integration for IMAT Prep Platform.

## Features Implemented

1. **Premium Test Locking**: Tests 1-3 remain free, while tests 4 and beyond are locked behind a premium subscription.
2. **Razorpay Payment Integration**: One-time payment of â‚¬49 to unlock premium tests.
3. **Supabase Database**: Stores subscription status and payment records linked to Clerk user IDs.
4. **Authentication with Clerk**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
5. **New Premium Pricing Page**: Dedicated page for purchasing the premium subscription.

## Components Created

### Supabase Database Structure

- `user_subscriptions` table: Tracks user subscription status
- `payment_records` table: Records payment attempts and status

### Supabase Client Functions

- `checkUserSubscription`: Verifies if user has an active subscription
- `createUserSubscriptionRecord`: Creates initial subscription record
- `updateUserSubscription`: Updates subscription status after payment
- `createPaymentRecord`: Records payment attempt
- `updatePaymentRecord`: Updates payment status

### Razorpay Integration

- `createOrder`: Creates a payment order
- `verifyPayment`: Validates payment signature
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`: Exported for client-side payment UI

### API Endpoints

- `/api/check-subscription`: Checks subscription status
- `/api/razorpay/create-order`: Creates Razorpay order
- `/api/razorpay/verify-payment`: Verifies payment and updates subscription

### React Components

- `SubscriptionGuard`: HOC to protect premium content
- `useSubscription`: Custom hook for checking subscription status

### Pages

- `/pricing/premium`: New premium subscription page
- Updated `/mock-tests`: Modified to show premium badges and lock premium tests

## User Flow

1. User accesses the mock tests page
2. Free tests (1-3) are accessible to all users
3. When attempting to access a premium test (4+):
   - If not logged in: Redirected to login page
   - If logged in but no subscription: Redirected to premium pricing page
4. On the premium pricing page:
   - User can see pricing information
   - User clicks "Upgrade Now" to initiate payment
5. Razorpay checkout window appears:
   - User enters payment details
   - Completes payment
6. After successful payment:
   - Payment is verified
   - Subscription status is updated in Supabase
   - User is redirected back to mock tests
   - User now has access to all premium tests

## Technical Notes

- The Supabase client is initialized with both anonymous and service roles for different operations
- Razorpay payment flow follows their recommended 3-step process: create order, handle payment, verify signature
- Subscription status is checked on-demand with the useSubscription hook
- All premium tests are wrapped with the SubscriptionGuard component to prevent unauthorized access

## Getting Started

1. Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor to create the necessary tables
2. Set up environment variables in `.env.local` with Supabase and Razorpay credentials
3. Start the application with `npm run dev`
4. Test the premium access system by trying to access Tests 4+
